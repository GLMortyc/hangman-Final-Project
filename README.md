# Hangman-Final-Project
This is my final project for Raspberry pi and python. I've decided to program a game of hangman and use pygame to make it into a game on a site. Currently I have it up on pygame with it showing the hangman and the pole to hang them. After inputing your level(the amount of letters in the word), there will be three or more lines showing the spaces for the letters.
